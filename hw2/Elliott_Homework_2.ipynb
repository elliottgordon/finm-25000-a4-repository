Hedge Funds.\n","\n","\n","* a. Using just the information in the case, what are two measures by which hedge funds are an attractive investment?\n","\n","1. Attractive returns. From 1994 to 2013, hedge funds had 10% higher retursn than stock and more than twice as much as bonds. Additionally, hedge funds provided a \"smoother ride\" (i.e. a lower vol.).\n","2. Attractive risk-return characteristics in terms of sharpe ratio. Hedge funds has less than half the vol. of the S&P 500 and had annualized returns less than 1% lower than those respective companies. As a result, hedge fund allocation could provide a dominant efficient frontier and diversification benefits.\n","\n","* b. What are the main benefits of investing in hedge funds via an ETF instead of directly?\n","\n","There are many benefits for investing in hedge fund ETFs compared to direct investment.\n","- Democratization: more access for retail investors to hedge fund beta, rules-based investments strategy, lower fees (more money in the hands of investors)\n","- - Accessibility\n","- - Transparency\n","- - Lower fees\n","- - Liquidity\n","- - Diversification\n","- - Regulatory oversight\n","- - Tax reporting"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f1c6d57d","metadata":{"id":"f1c6d57d"},"source":["## 3. The Benchmarks\n","\n","* a. Explain as simply as possible how HFRI, MLFM, MLFM-ES, and HDG differ in their construction and purpose.\n","\n","- - HFRI: a index available for hedge fund investors that was designed to reflect the collective performance of hedge funds through an equally weighted composite of over 2,000 constituent hedge funds that were available to accredited investors\n","- - MLFM: a statistical multi-factor model designed to track the performance of hedge funds (Factors: S&P 500, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets, Eurodollar/US dollar exchange rate, three-month Eurodollar Deposit yields)\n","- - MLFM-ES: an adapted version MLFM but the six index components were tradable, the three-month Eurodollar deposit yields were replaced with US Treasury Bills and the dollar/euro exchange rates were replaced with ProShares UltraShort Euro (EUO)\n","- - HDG: Hedge Fund Replication ETF, a ProShare's liquid alternative strategy product that provided exposure to hedge funds at low fees, with full transparency and providing daily liquidity\n","\n","* b.

What are the main concerns you have for how the MLFM attempts to replicate the HFRI?\n","\n","- - The factors were limited and didn't fully envelope potential sources of returns in HFRI\n","- - The regression used to determine the weights was backward-looking and lagged behind changes in hedge fund styles\n","- - Whether the model captures hedge fund alpha or beta. The purpose of investing is to earn \"alpha\" but if MLFM only captured beta to the factor than it might not replicate the skill of the hedge fund managers\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8247c669","metadata":{"id":"8247c669"},"source":["## 4.

HDG is, by construction, delivering beta for investors. Isn't the point of hedge funds to generate alpha?
